# GOAL

This is a demo to show-case how to implement AJAX in rails  using the [`stimulus.js`](https://stimulusjs.org/).

[You can also check my other demos](https://github.com/andrerferrer/dedemos/blob/master/README.md#ded%C3%A9mos).

## What needs to be done?

### 1. Add `stimulus.js` to the rails app with webpacker
```
rails webpacker:install:stimulus
```

### 2.  Handle it the stimulus way

- Create the controller
app/javascript/controller

- Add data-controller to the HTML element
app/views/restaurants/index.html.erb



And we're good to go ðŸ¤“
Good Luck and Have Fun
